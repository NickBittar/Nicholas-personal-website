            <p>I have been very interested in computers since I was young.  My passion has grown exponentially since then as I finish my time studying computer science in a university.  I regularly spend my free time reading about new and upcoming technologies.  I like to be informed about many different areas of computer science from cryptology to software design, web based projects to computer architecture, I appreciate most topics related to computers.</p>

            <h3>3-D Graphics Engine</h3>
            <img class="project-img" src="res/3dgraphics.png" onclick="enlarge(this)" />
            <p>In CSC 443 - Computer Graphics I created my own 3-D graphics engine from scratch for my final project.  It was written in Java and was able to display a rotating 3-D object's (such as a cube) wireframe and faces and I also applied Phong's lighting equation to the model to simulate a light source.</p>
            <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
            <img class="project-img" src="res/tictactoe.png" onclick="enlarge(this)" />
            <p>In my free time, for practice, I coded the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in Java.  It uses graphics and images I created for it to make the interface instead of using Java's provided elements such as JButtons.</p>
            <h3>Connect Four</h3>
            <img class="project-img" src="res/connectfour.png" onclick="enlarge(this)" />
            <p>I also created Connect Four in Java, created similarily to my Tic-Tac-Toe game featured hand made graphics and interface elements.  The most difficult part of coding this game was coding the check if a player has won.</p>
